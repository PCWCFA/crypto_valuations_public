# Tests
All the test cases are accompanied by an Excel of the same name. Ex: tc_conf_001.xlsx and tc_cv_001.xslx. The
pre-conditions, post conditions, and results are captured in the crypto_valuation_test_cases.xlsx as Excel comments 
in the Actual Results column. You can see these comments by having the mouse pointer in the cell.

## Mandatory Test
See crypto_valuation_test_cases.xlsx. I recommend that you run config.py's tc_conf_001 to ensure that your local copy
is configured and working correctly. You'll have to copy tc_conf_001.xlsx to the source-file directory and rename the 
file as crypto_valuations.xlsx, ensure that all the pre-conditions are met, and run the test case from 
crypto_valuation.xlsx's xlwing plugin's Run Main button. 

## Optional Tests
All other test cases are optional to be re-run after a pull request, but you're welcome to re-run them.
